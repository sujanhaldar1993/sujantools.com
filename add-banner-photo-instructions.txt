TO ADD YOUR REAL PHOTO:

1. 📸 PREPARE YOUR PHOTO:
   ========================
   - Use the photo you shared (looks professional!)
   - Recommended size: 400x400px to 800x800px
   - Format: JPG, PNG, or WEBP
   - File size: Under 1MB for fast loading
   - Good lighting and clear visibility

2. 💾 SAVE THE PHOTO:
   ===================
   - Save your photo in this folder: C:\Users\sujan\Desktop\sujantech
   - Name it: "sujan-banner-photo.jpg" (or .png/.webp)

3. 🔧 UPDATE HTML CODE:
   ====================
   Open "index.html" and find line ~72 (the SVG section)
   
   REPLACE this entire SVG section:
   ```html
   <svg width="250" height="250" viewBox="0 0 250 250" class="founder-image">
   ... (entire SVG code) ...
   </svg>
   ```
   
   WITH this image tag:
   ```html
   <img src="sujan-banner-photo.jpg" alt="Sujan - Founder & Developer" class="founder-image">
   ```

4. 🚀 TEST:
   ==========
   - Save the HTML file
   - Refresh your website
   - Check if your photo appears in the banner
   - Test hover effects (photo should scale and show "Founder" badge)
   - Test on mobile/tablet for responsiveness

❌ Photo not showing? 
   → Check file name and path
   → Make sure file is in correct folder

❌ Photo looks stretched?
   → CSS uses object-fit: cover (automatically crops to fit)
   
❌ Want to change photo size?
   → Modify .photo-frame width/height in styles.css
