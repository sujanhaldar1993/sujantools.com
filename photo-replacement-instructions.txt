HOW TO ADD YOUR PHOTO TO THE HEADER:

1. Save your photo in the project folder (C:\Users\sujan\Desktop\sujantech)
2. Rename it to "sujan-photo.jpg" (or keep the current name and update the HTML)
3. Make sure the photo is:
   - Good quality
   - Square aspect ratio (1:1) works best
   - Not too large (under 1MB recommended)
   - JPG, PNG, or WEBP format

CURRENT STATUS:
✅ Header HTML updated with photo placeholder
✅ CSS styling added for circular profile photo
✅ Responsive design implemented
✅ Hover effects added
✅ Professional border and shadow styling

The photo will appear as:
- 50px diameter circle on desktop
- 42px on tablet
- 38px on mobile
- Blue border that changes to orange on hover
- Subtle shadow and scale effects

If you want to change the photo later, just replace the "sujan-photo.jpg" file with a new one using the same name.
